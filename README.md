This is the repo for my DOHackathon submission.

The idea behind it, is sending a hug that you can really feel. <br>
How? you may ask, well it's simple, haptic feedback (more specifically vibration). <br>
You can record a hug, and send it to your loved ones, then all they have to do, is place their phones on their chest, and feel your special hug!
